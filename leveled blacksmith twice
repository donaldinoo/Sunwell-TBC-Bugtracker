Lilith the Lithe In winterspring wont let me train hammersmith after dropping it and releveling blacksmithing 
Greetings! So I did the weponsmith quest earlier on in the server and dropped blacksmithing a few weeks ago. now im re leveling it so i can recraft maces >.< but the weponsmith that gives the quest wont retrain me as a weponsmith nor does he have a quest. Please help : '{  i should be able to just talk to the npc in winterspring(Lilith the Lithe) and get hammersmithing but that wont work either
It should be trainable but im guessing dropping blacksmithing caused an issue 
to reproduce this bug train bs/hammersmith drop it for another profession then try to re train bs/hammersmith.
